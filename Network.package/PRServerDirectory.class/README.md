Add support to publish or download projects from Small-Land Project
Repository (SLPR).

The SLPR has virtual folders where the projects appears.  The SLPR can
be acceded from the FileList or from the web interface at
http://repository.small-land.org:8080

Basically it's a type of superswiki (but better ;)).

The features in SMPR not present in SuperSwiki are:

- Both the web interface and the squeak-side interface are full
translatable.   The server has translations for English and Spanish just
now, but it's almost trivial to include other translations... Stef?
Marcus? ;)

- The projects are categorized in "virtual" folder.  These folders (By
Category, By Author, By Language, Alphabetical, etc) give us good
searching behaviour just using the FileList and mouse clicks.

- The web interface (also full translatable) has a search a la google.

- All the urls to query the web interface are "clean enough" so google
can make a good job indexing our content in .pr files.


It's planned to add "editing" features to the web interface to
re-categorize, remove, etc projects.


Enjoy it,
