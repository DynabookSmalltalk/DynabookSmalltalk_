	However, in the FTP protocol, multiple lines are allowed.  
	If the response is multi-line, the fourth character of the first line is a  
	$- and the last line repeats the numeric code but the code is followed by 
	a space. So it's possible that there are more lines left of the last response that 
	we need to throw away. We use peekForAll: so that we don't discard the
