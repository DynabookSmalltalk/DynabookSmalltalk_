This class supports a simple interface to the serial ports of the underlying platform, if it supports serial ports. The mapping of port numbers to hardware ports is platform specific, but typically follows platform ordering conventions. For example, on the Macintosh, port 0 is the modem port and port 1 is the printer port, since in the programmers documentation these ports are referred to as ports A and B.
