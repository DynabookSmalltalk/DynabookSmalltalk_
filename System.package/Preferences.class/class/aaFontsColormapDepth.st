aaFontsColormapDepth
	"Adjust balance between colored AA text quality (especially if subpixel AA is used) and space / performance.
	5 is optimal quality. Each colorMap takes 128kB of RAM, and takes several seconds to build.
	4 is a reasonable balance. Each colorMap takes 16kB of RAM and builds fast on a fast machine.
	3 is good for slow hardware or memory restrictions. Each colorMap takes 2 kb of RAM."
