	"Note:  The standardCodeFont is not currently used -- the default font is instead; later hopefully we can split the code font out as  a separate choice, but only after we're able to have the protocols reorganized such that we can know whether it's code or not when we launch the text object.

	Note:  The standard button font is reset by this code but is not otherwise settable by a public UI (too many things can go afoul) "
