vm profiling
profile: aBlock
	"Make a virtual machine profile of the given block."
	"Note: Profiling support is provided so that VM implementors
	 can better understand and improve the efficiency of the virtual
	 machine. To use it, you must be running a version of the
	 virtual machine compiled with profiling enabled (which
	 makes it much slower than normal even when not profiling).
	 You will also need the CodeWarrior profile reader application."
