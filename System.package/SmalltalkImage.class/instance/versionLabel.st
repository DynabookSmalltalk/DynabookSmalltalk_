	represents the version level of the Smalltalk source code (interpreter
	and various plugins) that is translated to C by a CCodeGenerator,  in
	addition to the external platform source code, typically written in C and
	managed separately for each platform.
	
	This invokes an optional primitive that may not be available on all virtual
	machines. See also vmVersion, which answers a string identifying the image
	from which virtual machine sources were generated."
