	"The Cog VM can be instructed not to yield on process preemption,
	 i.e. not to put a preempted process at the back of its run queue.  By
	 default preempting a process causes it to yield (Blue Book semantics)
	 which can have unfortunate effects.
	 This flag persists across snapshots, stored in the image header."
