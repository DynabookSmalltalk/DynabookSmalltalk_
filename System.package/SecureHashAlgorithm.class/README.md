This class implements the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) described in the U.S. government's Secure Hash Standard (SHS). This standard is described in FIPS PUB 180-1, "SECURE HASH STANDARD", April 17, 1995.

The Secure Hash Algorithm is also described on p. 442 of 'Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C' by Bruce Scheier, Wiley, 1996.

See the comment in class DigitalSignatureAlgorithm for details on its use.

Implementation notes:
The secure hash standard was created with 32-bit hardware in mind. All arithmetic in the hash computation must be done modulo 2^32. This implementation uses ThirtyTwoBitRegister objects to simulate hardware registers; this implementation is about six times faster than using LargePositiveIntegers (measured on a Macintosh G3 Powerbook). Implementing a primitive to process each 64-byte buffer would probably speed up the computation by a factor of 20 or more.
