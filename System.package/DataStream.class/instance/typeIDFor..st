typeIDFor: anObject
	"Return the typeID for anObject's class.  This is where the tangle of objects is clipped to stop everything from going out.  
	Classes can control their instance variables by defining objectToStoreOnDataStream.
	Any object in blockers is not written out.  See ReferenceStream.objectIfBlocked: and DataStream nextPut:.
	Morphs do not write their owners.  See Morph.storeDataOn:   Each morph tells itself to 'prepareToBeSaved' before writing out."
