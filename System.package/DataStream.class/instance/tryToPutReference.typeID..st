tryToPutReference: anObject typeID: typeID
    "PRIVATE -- If we support references for type typeID, and if
       anObject already appears in my output stream, then put a
       reference to the place where anObject already appears. If we
       support references for typeID but didn't already put anObject,
       then associate the current stream position with anObject in
       case one wants to nextPut: it again.
     Return true after putting a reference; false if the object still
       needs to be put.
     For DataStream this is trivial. ReferenceStream overrides this."
