read/write segment primitives
storeSegmentFor: rootsArray into: segmentWordArray outPointers: outPointerArray
	"This primitive will store a binary image segment (in the same format as the Squeak
	 image file) of the receiver and every object in its proper tree of subParts (ie, that is
	 not refered to from anywhere else outside the tree).  Note: all elements of the reciever
	 are treated as roots in determining the extent of the tree.  All pointers from within
	 the tree to objects outside the tree will be copied into the array of outpointers.  In
	 their place in the image segment will be an oop equal to the offset in the outpointer
	 array (the first would be 4 or 8, depending on word size). but with the high bit set.

	 Note: the first element of the segmentWordArray (and hence the first element of
	 the Array answered by loadSegmentFrom:outPointers:) is the rootsArray."

	"The primitive expects the array and wordArray to be more than adequately long.
	 In this case it returns normally, and truncates the two arrays to exactly the right size.
	 If either array is too small, the primitive will fail, but in no other case."
