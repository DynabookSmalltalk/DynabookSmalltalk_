checkDeep
	"Write exceptions in the Transcript.  Every class that implements veryDeepInner: must copy all its inst vars.  Danger is that a user will add a new instance variable and forget to copy it.  This check is only run by hand once in a while to make sure nothing was forgotten.  
(Please do not remove this method.)
