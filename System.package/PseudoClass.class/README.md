I provide an inert model of a Class, used by FileContentsBrowser to manipulate filedout code. Instead of a method dictionary or selectors onto CompiledMethods, I have a dictionary ("source") of selectors onto ChangeRecords, which were, in the case of FileContentsBrowser, parsed from a source or change set file.
