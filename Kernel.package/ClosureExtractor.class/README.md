A ClosureExtractor is a utility class that is used to extract all BlockClosures from a CompiledMethod. It inherits from InstructionClient and understands only one single message, namely that corresponding to the push closure bytecode instruction. Being sent this message, a ClosureExtractor will create a BlockClosure instance and evaluate the block it holds as an instance variable with that closure as parameter.
