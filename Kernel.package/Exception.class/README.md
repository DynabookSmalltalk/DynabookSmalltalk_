This is the main class used to implement the exception handling system (EHS).  It plays two distinct roles:  that of the exception, and that of the exception handler.  More specifically, it implements the bulk of the protocols laid out in the ANSI specification - those protocol names are reflected in the message categories.

Exception is an abstract class.  Instances should neither be created nor trapped.  In most cases, subclasses should inherit from Error or Notification rather than directly from Exception.

In implementing this EHS, The Fourth Estate Inc. incorporated some ideas and code from Craig Latta's EHS.  His insights were crucial in allowing us to implement BlockClosure>>valueUninterruptably (and by extension, #ensure: and #ifCurtailed:), and we imported the following methods with little or no modification:

Thanks, Craig!
