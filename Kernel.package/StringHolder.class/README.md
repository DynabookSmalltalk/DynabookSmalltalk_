I am a kind of Model that includes a piece of text.  In some cases, the text can be edited, and in some the text is a method.

Categories 'code pane menu' and 'message list menu' are messages that may be called by my menus when the text is a method, and when some pane is a list of methods.  Other of my subclasses may ignore these two catagories altogether.
