I am a support class for the decompiler that is used to find the number of local temps in a block by finding out what the stack offset is at the end of a block.  I am necessary because in the EncoderForV3PlusClosures bytecode set the only way to initialize block-local temporaries is with pushConstant: nil bytecodes, but such bytecodes are ambiguous with a pushConstant: nil used to pass nil as a parameter or answer it as a result.  By scanning through to the end of the block these can be disambiguated by tracking the stack depth.
