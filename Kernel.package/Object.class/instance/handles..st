error handling
handles: exception
	"This method exists in case a non exception class is the first arg in an on:do: (for instance using a exception class that is not loaded). We prefer this to raising an error during error handling itself. Also, semantically it makes sense that the exception handler is not active if its exception class is not loaded"
