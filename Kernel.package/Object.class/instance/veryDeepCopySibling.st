	"Do a complete tree copy using a dictionary.  Substitute a clone of oldPlayer for the root.  Normally, a Player or non systemDefined object would have a new class.  We do not want one this time.  An object in the tree twice, is only copied once.  All references to the object in the copy of the tree will point to the new copy."
