user interface
mouseUpBalk: evt
	"A button I own got a mouseDown, but the user moved out before letting up.  Certain kinds of objects (so-called 'radio buttons', for example, and other structures that must always have some selection, e.g. PaintBoxMorph) wish to take special action in this case; this default does nothing."
