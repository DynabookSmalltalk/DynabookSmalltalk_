updateThresholdForGraphicInViewerTab
	"When a Viewer is open on the receiver, its tab needs some graphic to show to the user. Computing this graphic can take quite some time so we want to make the update frequency depending on how long it takes to compute the thumbnail. The threshold returned by this method defines that the viewer will update at most every 'threshold * timeItTakesToDraw' milliseconds. Thus, if the time for computing the receiver's thumbnail is 200 msecs and the the threshold is 10, the viewer will update at most every two seconds."
