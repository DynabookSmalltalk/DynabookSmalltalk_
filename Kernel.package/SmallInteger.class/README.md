My instances are at least 31-bit numbers, stored in twos complement form. The allowable range in 32-bits is approximately +- 10^9 (+- 1billion).  In 64-bits my instances are 61-bit numbers, stored in twos complement form. The allowable range is approximately +- 10^18 (+- 1 quintillion).   The actual values are computed at start-up.  See SmallInteger class startUp:, minVal, maxVal.
