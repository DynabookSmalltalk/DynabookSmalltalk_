==> aBlock
	"this is material implication, a ==> b, also known as:
			b if a 
			a implies b
			if a then b
			b is a consequence of a
			a therefore b (but note: 'it is raining therefore it is cloudy' is implication; 'it is autumn therefore the leaves are falling' is equivalence).
		
	Here is the truth table for material implication (view in a monospaced font):

	   T   |   F   |      F
