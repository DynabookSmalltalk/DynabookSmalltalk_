	"CompiledMethod>>#= compares code, i.e. same literals and same bytecode.
	 So we look at the header, methodClass and some bytes between initialPC and endPC,
	 but /not/ the selector because the equal method does not compare selectors.
	 Note that we must override ByteArray>hash which looks at all bytes of the receiver.
	 Using bytes from the pointer part of a COmpiledmethod can lead to a variable hash
	 if and when when the GC moves literals in the receiver."
