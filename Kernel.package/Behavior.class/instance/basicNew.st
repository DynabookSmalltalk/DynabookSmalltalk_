basicNew
	"Primitive. Answer an instance of the receiver (which is a class) with no 
	 indexable variables. Fail if the class is indexable. Essential. See Object 
	 documentation whatIsAPrimitive.
	
	 If the primitive fails because space is low then the scavenger will run
	 before the method is activated.  Check that space was low and retry
	 via handleFailingBasicNew if so."
