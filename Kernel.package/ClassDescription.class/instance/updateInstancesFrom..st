	"Recreate any existing instances of the argument, oldClass, as instances of

	 and forward old instances to new instances.. Answer nil to defeat any clients

	"ar 7/15/1999: The updating below is possibly dangerous. If there are any
	contexts having an old instance as receiver it might crash the system if
	the new receiver in which the context is executed has a different layout.

"This attempts to crash the VM by stepping off the end of an instance.
 As the doctor says, do not do this."
