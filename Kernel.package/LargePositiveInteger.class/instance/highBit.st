bit manipulation
highBit
	"Answer the index of the high order bit of the receiver, or zero if the  
	receiver is zero. Raise an error if the receiver is negative, since  
	negative integers are defined to have an infinite number of leading 1's 
	in 2's-complement arithmetic. Use >>highBitOfMagnitude if you want to  
	get the highest bit of the magnitude."
