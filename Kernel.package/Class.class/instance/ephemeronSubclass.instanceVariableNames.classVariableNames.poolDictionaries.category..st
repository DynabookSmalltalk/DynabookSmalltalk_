	"This is the standard initialization message for creating a new class as a 
	subclass of an existing class (the receiver) in which the subclass is to 
	have ephemeron semantics, i.e. where the object will be queued for
	finalization when the key (first) inst var is not reachable other than through
	the other fields of ephemerons with unreachable keys."
