An IndentingListItemMorph is a StringMorph that draws itself with an optional toggle at its left, as part of the display of the SimpleHierarchicalListMorph.

It will also display lines around the toggle if the #showLinesInHierarchyViews Preference is set.

Instance variables:

indentLevel <SmallInteger> 	the indent level, from 0 at the root and increasing by 1 at each level of the hierarchy.

isExpanded <Boolean>		true if this item is expanded (showing its children)

complexContents <ListItemWrapper>	an adapter wrapping my represented item that can answer its children, etc.
	
firstChild <IndentingListItemMorph|nil>	my first child, or nil if none
	
container <SimpleHierarchicalListMorph>	my container
	
nextSibling <IndentingListItemMorph|nil>	the next item in the linked list of siblings, or nil if none.
