I am a list widget that uses the change/update mechanism to display model data as a vertical arrangement of (maybe formatted) strings and icons in a scroll pane.

When I am in keyboard focus, type in a letter (or several letters quickly) to go to the next item that begins with that letter. If you enabled the "filterable lists" preference, I will hide all items that do not match the filter.

Special keys (arrow up/down, page up/down, home, end) are also supported.
