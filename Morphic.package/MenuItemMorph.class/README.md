I represent an item in a menu.

Instance variables:
	isEnabled 	<Boolean>	True if the menu item can be executed.
	subMenu 	<MenuMorph | nil>	The submenu to activate automatically when the user mouses over the item.
	isSelected 	<Boolean>	True if the item is currently selected.
	target 		<Object>		The target of the associated action.
	selector 		<Symbol>	The associated action.
	arguments 	<Array>		The arguments for the associated action.
	icon		<Form | nil>	An optional icon form to be displayed to my left.

If I have a dynamic marker, created by strings like <yes> or <no> in my contents, it will be installed as a submorph.
