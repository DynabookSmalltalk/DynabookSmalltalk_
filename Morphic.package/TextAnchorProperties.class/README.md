A TextAnchorProperties describes the positioning of a morph in a text document included through a TextAnchor. The properties describe:
- general alignment of the morph (e.g. within the line or relative to the document)
- vertical alignment within a line
- padding applied in addition to the vertical alignment
- whether it consumes horizontal space when layouted inline
