I am a widget that helps users enter a numerically bounded value. I have a minimum and a maximum value. My thumb indicates my current value. My orientation can be vertical or horizontal, which is usually determined by the ratio of my extent. Nevertheless, you can force me to use a specific orientation,

Note that I can be pluggable and get data from a model.
