	"Support for experiments with drawing under program control. To get started, make a new SketchMorph in a morphic world. In an inspector, give it the desired pixel dimensions with clearExtent:fillColor:. Then use this method to get a pen to which you can send normal pen commands. Reveal the resulting drawing with revealPenStrokes."
