The scroller (a transform) of a scrollPane is driven by the scrollBar.  The scroll values vary from 0.0, meaning zero offset to 1.0 meaning sufficient offset such that the bottom of the scrollable material appears 3/4 of the way down the pane.  The total distance to achieve this range is called the totalScrollRange.
