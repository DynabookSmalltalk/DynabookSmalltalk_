I am a subclass of ImageReadWriter that understands JFIF file streams, and can decode JPEG images.
This code is based upon the Independent Joint Photographic Experts Group (IJPEG) software, originally written in C by Tom Lane, Philip Gladstone, Luis Ortiz, Jim Boucher, Lee Crocker, Julian Minguillon, George Phillips, Davide Rossi, Ge' Weijers, and other members of the Independent JPEG Group.
