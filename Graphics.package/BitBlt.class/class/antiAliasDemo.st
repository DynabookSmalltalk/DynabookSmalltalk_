	"This version uses a sliding buffer for painting that keeps pixels in 32 bits
	as long as they are in the buffer, so as not to lose info by converting down
	to display resolution and back up to 32 bits at each operation. - di 3/15/97"
	
	"This version also uses WarpBlt to paint into twice as large a buffer,
	and then use smoothing when reducing back down to the display.
	In fact this same routine will now work for 3x3 soothing as well.
	Remove the statements 'buff displayAt: 0@0' to hide the buffer. - di 3/19/97"
