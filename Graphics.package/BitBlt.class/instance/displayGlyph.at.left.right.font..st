	This happens when #installStrikeFont:foregroundColor:backgroundColor: sets rule 37 (rgbMul).
	the desired effect is to do two bitblt calls. The first one is with rule 37 and special colormap.
	The second one is rule 34, with a colormap for applying the requested foreground color.
	This two together do component alpha blending, i.e. alpha blend red, green and blue separatedly.
	This is needed for arbitrary color over abitrary background text with subpixel AA."
