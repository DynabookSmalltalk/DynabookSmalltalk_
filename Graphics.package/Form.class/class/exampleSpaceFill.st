	"This example demonstrates the area filling algorithm. Starts by having
	the user sketch on the screen (ended by option-click) and then select a rectangular
	area of the screen which includes all of the area to be filled. Finally,
	(with crosshair cursor), the user points at the interior of some region to be
	filled, and the filling begins with that place as its seed."
