I provide fast JPEG compression and decompression. I require the VM pluginJPEGReadWriter2Plugin, which is typically stored in same directory as the Squeak virtual machine.

JPEGReadWriter2Plugin is based on LIBJPEG library. This sentence applies to the plugin:
   "This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".

The LIBJPEG license allows it to be used free for any purpose so long as its origin and copyright are acknowledged. You can read more about LIBJPEG and get the complete source code at www.ijg.org.
