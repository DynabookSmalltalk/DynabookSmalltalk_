I represent Text whose emphasis changes are mapped to a set of fonts. My instances have an offset used in determining screen placement for displaying. They get used two different ways in the system. In the user interface, they mainly hold onto some text which is viewed by some form of ParagraphEditor. However, as a DisplayObject, they may need to display efficiently, so my instances have a cache for the bits.
