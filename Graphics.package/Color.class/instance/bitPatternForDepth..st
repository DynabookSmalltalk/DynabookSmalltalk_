bitPatternForDepth: depth
	"Return a Bitmap, possibly containing a stipple pattern, that best represents this color at the given depth. BitBlt calls this method to convert colors into Bitmaps. The resulting Bitmap may be multiple words to represent a stipple pattern of several lines.  "
	"See also:	pixelValueAtDepth:	-- value for single pixel
				pixelWordAtDepth:	-- a 32-bit word filled with the pixel value"
	"Details: The pattern for the most recently requested depth is cached."
	"Note for depths > 2, there are stippled and non-stippled versions (generated with #balancedPatternForDepth: and #bitPatternForDepth:, respectively). The stippled versions don't work with the window bit caching of StandardSystemView, so we make sure that for these depths, only unstippled patterns are returned"
