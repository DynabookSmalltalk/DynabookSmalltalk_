cachedColormapFrom: sourceDepth to: destDepth
	"Return a cached colormap for mapping between the given depths. Always return a real colormap, not nil; this allows the client to get an identity colormap that can then be copied and modified to do color transformations."
	"Note: This method returns a shared, cached colormap to save time and space. Clients that need to modify a colormap returned by this method should make a copy and modify that!"
	"Note: The colormap cache may be cleared by evaluating 'Color shutDown'."
