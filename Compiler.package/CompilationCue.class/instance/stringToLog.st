	"Answer a string to be logged in a change log.
	Implementation note:
	If the requestor is a TextEditor, preferably take its selection.
	This convoluted code is presumably crafted to avoid broken contents
	(ReadStream on: '123456' from: 3 to: 4) contents -> '1234'
	As long as selectionAsStream is using such construct this might be required."
