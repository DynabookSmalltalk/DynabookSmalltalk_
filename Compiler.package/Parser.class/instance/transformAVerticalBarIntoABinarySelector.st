	"Transform a vertical bar into a binary selector.
	Eventually aggregate a serie of immediately following vertical bars and a binary selector.
	Note that this aggregation cannot occur at scan time, because a pair of vertical bars can be encountered in two valid constructs:
	- either as an empty temporaries specification,
	- or as a local temporaries specification in a block of arity > 0"
