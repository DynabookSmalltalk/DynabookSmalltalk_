A SpecialSelectorNode is a subclass of SelectorNode that handles the special selectors, a high static and/or dynamic frequency set of selectors that are assigned their own bytecodes.  Special selectors both save space in the literal frame and allow an interpreter to implement these sends directly for certain classes of receiver and argument, for example the SmallIntegers, a technique known as static receiver prediction.
