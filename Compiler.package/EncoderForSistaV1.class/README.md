EncoderForSistaV1 encodes a bytecode set for Smalltalk that lifts limits on the number of literals and branch distances, and provides extended push integer and push character bytecodes.  The bytecode set also supports creating FullBlockClosures, closures whose method is separate from their home method's.  Bytecodes are ordered by length to make decoding easier.  Bytecodes marked with an * are extensible via a prefix bytecode.

N.B.  Extension bytecodes can only come before extensible bytecodes, and only if valid (one cannot extend a bytecode extensible by Ext A with an Ext B).  An extensible bytecode consumes (and zeros) its extension(s).  Hence the hidden implicit variables holding extensions are always zero except after a valid sequence of extension bytecodes.

EncoderForSistaV1 also includes an extended set of bytecodes for Sista, the Speculative Inlining Smalltalk Architecture, a project by ClÃ©ment Bera and Eliot Miranda.  Scorch is an optimizer that exists in the Smalltalk image, /not/ in the VM,  and optimizes by substituting normal bytecoded methods by optimized bytecoded methods that may use special bytecodes for which the Cogit can generate faster code.  These bytecodes eliminate overheads such as bounds checks or polymorphic code (indexing Array, ByteArray, String etc).  But the bulk of the optimization performed is in inlining blocks and sends for the common path.  This bytecode set therefore differs from a normal Smalltalk set in providing a set of inlined primitives that do not validate their arguments that the compiler generates only when it can prove that the primitives' arguments are valid.

The basic scheme is that the Cogit generates code containing performance counters.  When these counters trip, a callback into the image is performed, at which point Scorch analyses some portion of the stack, looking at performance data for the methods on the stack, and optimises based on the stack and performance data.  Execution then resumes in the optimized code.

The Sista Cogit (e.g. SistaStackToRegisterMappingCogit) adds counters to conditional branches.  Each branch has an executed and a taken count.  On execution the executed count is decremented and if the count goes below zero the VM sends a message at a special index in the specialObjectsArray (as of writing, conditionalCounterTrippedOn:).  Then if the branch is taken the taken count is decremented.  The two counter values allow the Sista optimizer to collect basic block execution paths and to know what are the "hot" paths through execution that are worth agressively optimizing.  Since conditional branches are about 1/6 as frequent as sends, and since they can be used to determine the hot path through code, they are a better choice to count than, for example, method or block entry.

The VM provides a primitive that fills an Array with the state of the counters, and the state of each linked send in a method.  The optimizer obtains the branch and send data for a method via this primitive.

(1) Bytecode 235 is a super send bytecode that starts the lookup in the superclass of some class.  It has two forms, "normal" and "directed". In the normal form, the class is the value of the method's methodClassAssociation which must be the last literal.  In the directed form the class is the class on top of stack.

(2) The Call Primitive Bytecode specifies either a primitive in the primitive table (m=0) or an inlined primitive (m=1). Non-inlined primitives from the primitive table have index (jjjjjjj * 256) + iiiiiiii and return from the method if they succeed.  This bytecode is only valid as the first bytecode of a method.  Inline primitives have index (jjjjjjj * 256) + iiiiiiii, cannot fail, and do not return when they succeed, yielding a result (typically on top of stack after popping their arguments, but possibly in a byte data stack, for example for unboxed floating-point primitives).

(3) ExtB lowest bit implies no store check is needed, ExtB second bit implies the object may be a context, ExtB third bit implies no immutability/read-only check is needed, other bits in the extension are unused.

(4) ExtA = 1 implies no mustBeBoolean trampoline is needed, other bits in the extension are unused


Here is the specification of the Sista unsafe instructions (unsafe operations, set 00). The lowcode set uses external specifications.
We sort the inline primitive operations by arity.  Nullary primitives occupy the 0-999 range. Unary primitives occupy the 1-1999 range, up until 8 args. 8191 instructions can be encoded in each unsafe operation set, instructions from 0 to 7 arguments can have 1000 different instructions each, while 8 args instructions can have 192 different instructions.
