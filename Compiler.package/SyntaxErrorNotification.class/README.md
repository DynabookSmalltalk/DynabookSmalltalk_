A SyntaxErrorNotification is an Exception occuring when compiling a Smalltalk source code with incorrect syntax.
Note that in interactive mode, this exception is not raised because the Compiler will interact directly with source code editor.
The defaultAction is to raise a SyntaxError pop up window so as to enable interactive handling even in non interactive mode.
