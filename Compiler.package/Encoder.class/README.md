I encode names and literals into tree nodes with byte codes for the compiler. Byte codes for literals are not assigned until the tree-sizing pass of the compiler, because only then is it known which literals are actually needed. I also keep track of sourceCode ranges during parsing and code generation so I can provide an inverse map for the debugger.
