temps
bindBlockArg: name within: aBlockNode
	"With standard Smalltalk-80 (BlueBook) blocks it used to be legal to use a
	 method temp as a block argument.  This shouldn't be the case with the
	 current compiler, which checks for temp names already being used as
	 block arguments.  But it is easily fooled by local block temps in optimized
	 blocks, e.g.
		false
			ifTrue: [| temp |]
			ifFalse:[[:temp|]]
	Rather than fix this we keep the semantics and fix it in the closure compiler."
