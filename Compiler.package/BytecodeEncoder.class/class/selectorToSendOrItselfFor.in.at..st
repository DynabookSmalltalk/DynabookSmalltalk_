instruction stream support
selectorToSendOrItselfFor: anInstructionStream in: method at: pc
	"If anInstructionStream is at a send bytecode then answer the send's selector,
	 otherwise answer anInstructionStream itself.  The rationale for answering
	 anInstructionStream instead of, say, nil, is that potentially any existing object
	 can be used as a selector, but since anInstructionStream postdates the method,
	 it can't be one of them."
