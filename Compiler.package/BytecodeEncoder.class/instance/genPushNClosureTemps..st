	"To reduce the number of bytecodes required, the embedded
	 block closure implementation uses explicit push nil instructions
	 to create block-local temps.  In bytecode sets supporting
	 FullBlockClosure/CompiledBlock this isn't needed and the
	 number of temps is derived from the block method header."
