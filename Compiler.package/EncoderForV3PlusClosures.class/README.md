An encoder for the V3 bytecode set augmented with the following bytecodes that are part of the full closure implementation.
	138   10001010 jkkkkkkk		Push (Array new: kkkkkkk) (j = 0)
								or	Pop kkkkkkk elements into: (Array new: kkkkkkk) (j = 1)
	139   10001011 kkkkkkkk jjjjjjjj 	Invoke primitive number jjjjjjjjkkkkkkkk
	140   10001100 kkkkkkkk jjjjjjjj 	Push Temp At kkkkkkkk In Temp Vector At: jjjjjjjj
	141   10001101 kkkkkkkk jjjjjjjj 	Store Temp At kkkkkkkk In Temp Vector At: jjjjjjjj
	142   10001110 kkkkkkkk jjjjjjjj 	Pop and Store Temp At kkkkkkkk In Temp Vector At: jjjjjjjj

This is an exact duplicate of EncoderForLongFormV3PlusClosures.
Could be a trait (or in Newspeak, a Mixin).
For now we impose upon you to synchronise any and all changes between these two classes.
