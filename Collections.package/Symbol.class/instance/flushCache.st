system primitives
flushCache
	"Tell the interpreter to remove all entries with this symbol as a selector from its method lookup cache, if it has one.  This primitive must be called whenever a method is defined or removed.
	NOTE:  Only one of the two selective flush methods needs to be used.
	Squeak 2.3 and later uses 116 (See CompiledMethod flushCache)."
