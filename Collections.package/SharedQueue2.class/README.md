An implementation of a shared queue based on class Monitor.  Clients may may place items on the queue using nextPut: or remove them using methods like next or nextOrNil.  Items are removed in first-in first-out (FIFO) order.  It is safe for multiple threads to access the same shared queue, which is why this is a "shared" queue.

[monitor] is used to synchronize access from multiple threads.

[items] is an ordered collection holding the items that are in the queue.  New items are added  at the end, and old items are removed from the beginning.

All methods must hold the monitor while they run.
