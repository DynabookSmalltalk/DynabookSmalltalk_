I am a canvas for generating Encapsulates PostScript (EPS) files from single morphs, for example for screen-dumps.

I make sure that the bounding box of the EPS surrounds exactly the morph, and am not capable of generating multiple pages.  I do not generate an on-screen Preview for the EPS file, though that should be possible.
