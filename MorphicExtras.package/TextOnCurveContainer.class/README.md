I am not really a container in the sense of TextContainer.  However, I get stored in the same field of a textMorph.  My baseline specifies the vertical displacement of the character baselines from the curve center (0 means on center, 5 would mean, eg, the character baselines are 5 pixels above the curve center).  This is ssential enduring information.  I also cache temporary layout information, including the locations, angles and bounding boxes of each of the characters as displayed.
