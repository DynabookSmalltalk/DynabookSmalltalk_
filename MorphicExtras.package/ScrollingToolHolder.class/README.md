Used to hold stamp images in the PaintBox. Displays a small number of the available stamps and allows scrolling to access the others. One stamp is always kept blank as a way to create new stamps.

Note:
	stamps are the full size Forms
	thumbnailPics are the shrunken ones
	nil in both lists means no stamp yet, so user can create one
