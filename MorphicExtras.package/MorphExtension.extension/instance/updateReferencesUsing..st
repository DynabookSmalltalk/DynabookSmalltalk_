	"Update intra-morph references within a composite morph that  
	has been copied. For example, if a button refers to morph X in  
	the orginal  
	composite then the copy of that button in the new composite  
	should refer to  
	the copy of X in new composite, not the original X. This default  
	implementation updates the contents of any morph-bearing slot."
