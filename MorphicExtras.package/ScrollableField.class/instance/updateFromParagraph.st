	"A change has taken place in my paragraph, as a result of  
	editing and I must be updated. If a line break causes  
	recomposition of the current paragraph, or it the selection has 
	entered a different paragraph, then the current editor will be  
	released, and must be reinstalled with the resulting new  
	paragraph, while retaining any editor state, such as selection,  
	undo state, and current typing emphasis."
